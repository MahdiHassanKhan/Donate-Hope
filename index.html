            <h1>Their lives depend on your donation</h1>
            <p>You might think about charity as something you do with the extra change you find lying around, or by
                supporting a friend running in a local race. That's how we used to feel — until we learned how much even
                a modest amount of charity can accomplish when given to the right organizations.</p>

            <p>Why is donating very important?
                By giving to charity, you may well be helping to remind friends and family of causes they themselves are
                passionate about and would like to support. Your charitable donations could even bring about a
                family-wide effort to back a charity or charities that have special significance to you as a group.</p>
